	Solution: A solution contains a list of classes with their assignments.
	There are also a few solution attributes that can be used to identify the
	solution. These are:
		- problem name (only needed when the XML does not contain the problem,
				i.e., solution is the root element)
		- solver runtime in seconds,
		- number of CPU cores that the solver employs (optional, defaults to 1),
		- name of the solver technique/algorithm,
		- name of the competitor or his/her team,
		- and the name and the country of the institution of the competitor
